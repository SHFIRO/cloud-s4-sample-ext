# S/4HANA Cloud extensions - Deploy SCP Fiori App to S/4HANA Cloud
This simple Fiori UI sample application showcases an extension to an SAP S/4HANA Cloud system. It lists the actual stock movement information (from a custom CDS view) with extended material information (from a custom field).<br/> This very simple app is to be seen in the context of the overall scenario which takes up several focal extensibility topics. The scenario is rather to show how you can do in-app extensions on SAP S/4HANA Cloud, expose a service from a Custom CDS view and consume this service in a custom SAP Fiori UI on SAP Cloud Platform. Furthermore, the scenario includes the topic of deploying the custom UI from SAP Cloud Platform to S/4HANA Cloud as well as a description on transporting extensions from a quality to a productive system. 

> **NOTE:** To implement this sample app in your own landscape, you need to do some preparation steps. These steps are outlined in the set-up instructions guide. There, you will find more details on the end to end steps, e.g.:
> * Creation of a custom field in SAP S/4HANA Cloud
> * Connection setup of the SAP S/4HANA Cloud system and SAP Cloud Platform (via a communication arrangement)
> * Deployment of the sample app
> * Integration of the custom app on the S/4HANA Cloud Launchpad
> * Transportation of the custom UI and extenstions from a quality to a productive SAP S/4HANA Cloud system


Requirements
-------------
1. We assume that you have administrative access to an SAP S/4HANA Cloud system and an SAP Cloud Platform account.
2. You have set up the landscape and done the prerequisite steps (e.g. created a custom field/Custom CDS view/communication arrangement etc.) according to the Set-up instructions guide.
